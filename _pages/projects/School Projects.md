This is a simple Flask Web App that uses Create, retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a Web Application system for a cruise ship company. This is to make the check in process more efficient for cruise passengers, with the COVID-19 measures in place. I was tasked to create and manage health declaration status of users.
